# Rules
  - Forks are to be created, instead of pushing code regularly. (I will explain)
    - Once the merge is complete, the code will be tested, and then the fork will be archived.
    - this is an example
    - this is yet another example
  - File Conflicts caused by merging are to be properly resolved in the Issues tab.
  - The original members of Bluecube will be Co-founders, and anybody who joins afterward is simply "Member"
  - Make sure forks are private
  - Please try to use https://desktop.github.com/ (recomended for beginners or if you dont want to use a command line) or the _official_ Git CLI that has existed from the beginning of Git from https://git-scm.com/ (if you are experienced or want to get experience for the future) with bigger commits (e.g. more than 1 file changed at a time) when possible, as your changes will be included in one commit.

  - If you don't know how to use the Github Desktop, here is a simple tutorial. On GitHub, click the green "code" button, copy the https link, go into github desktop, click file, clone repository to get a local copy of the repository on your machine, and then use an IDE or text editor, (we suggest using Visual Studio Code) to edit the code. Use repository > pull to update your local copy of the repository when someone does a commit. Use repository > push to push your commits to the repository. (Please remember, though, that at Bluecube, instead of using "repository > push", we require you to fork the repository, use "repository > push" on the forked repository, and then make a GitHub pull request with that fork!)

  - If you don't know how to use the Git CLI, here is a quick tutorial for basic commits on the main branch: On GitHub, click the green "code" button and copy the HTTPS clone link. Next, use use "git clone [https clone source]" to get a local copy of that repository on your machine, change the files however you want using whichever tools you want, then use "git add --all" to add all your files to the commit, use "git commit -m [commit message]" to actually do a commit, and use "git push" to push the changes to the repository. The commit should show up in GitHub after 30 seconds and a full refresh if you did it correctly. Use "git pull" to update the local copy of your repository when someone does a commit. (Please remember, though, that at Bluecube, instead of using "git push", we require you to fork the repository, use "git push" on the forked repository, and then make a GitHub pull request with that fork!)
