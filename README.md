# Rules
  - Forks are to be created, instead of pushing code regularly. (I will explain)
    - Once the merge is complete, the code will be tested, and then the fork will be archived.
    - this is an example
    - this is yet another example
  - File Conflicts caused by merging are to be properly resolved in the Issues tab.
  - The original members of Bluecube will be Co-founders, and anybody who joins afterward is simply "Member"
  - Make sure forks are private
  - Please try to use https://desktop.github.com/ with bigger commits (e.g. more than 1 file changed at a time) when possible, as your changes will be included in one commit.
  - If you don't know how to use the github desktop, here is a tutorial. click the green "code" button, copy the https link, go into github desktop, click file, clone repository, and then use an IDE, (suggested to use https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/ community version, as it is free.) to edit the code
