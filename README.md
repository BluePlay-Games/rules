# Rules
  - Forks are to be created, instead of pushing code regularly. (I will explain)
    - Once the merge is complete, the code will be tested, and then the fork will be archived.
  - File Conflicts caused by merging are to be properly resolved in the Issues tab.
  - The original members of Bluecube will be Co-founders, and anybody who joins afterward is simply "Member"
  - Make sure forks are private
