# Rules
  - Forks are to be created, instead of pushing code regularly. (I will explain)
    - Once the merge is complete, the code will be tested, and then the fork will be archived.
    - this is an example
    - this is yet another example
  - File Conflicts caused by merging are to be properly resolved in the Issues tab.
  - The original members of Bluecube will be Co-founders, and anybody who joins afterward is simply "Member"
  - Make sure forks are private
  - Please try to use the Git CLI from https://git-scm.com/ with bigger commits (e.g. more than 1 file changed at a time) when possible, as your changes will be included in one commit.
  - If you don't know how to use the Git CLI, here is a quick tutorial for basic commits on the main branch: use "git clone" to get a local copy of a repository on your machine, change the files however you want using whichever tools you want, then use "git add --all" to add all your files to the commit, use "git commit -m [commit message]" to actually do a commit, and use "git push" to push the changes to the repository. The commit should show up in GitHub if you did it correctly. Use "git pull" to update the repository with the latest code changes. (Please remember, though, that at Bluecube, instead of using "git push", we require you to fork the repository, use "git push" on the forked repository, and then make a GitHub pull request with that fork!)
